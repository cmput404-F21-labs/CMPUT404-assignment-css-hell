                  <div class="p-container">
                    <p>Johnny Silverhand, born as Robert John Linder, was a famous 
                      influential rockerboy and the lead singer of the band Samurai 
                      before its breakup in 2008. A military veteran who defined 
                      the rockerboy movement to what it is today. He was the most 
                      prominent figure that fought against the corrupted NUSA government 
                      and the megacorporations, often being described as a terrorist. 
                      Johnny is charismatic and quite the charmer. However he is also 
                      known to be irrational, impulsive, and a manipulator.

                  <h1>A Little History</h1>
                  <div class="p-container">
                    <p>The name of the band was Samurai. Johnny started this band with 
                      his friend Kerry Eurodyne, originally only playing in backstreet 
                      clubs. Their first gig was in Red Dirt a small bar in Night City. 
                      In 2003, while playing in a bar called Rainbow Cadenza, a producer 
                      by name of Jack Masters discovered them and signed them up with 
                      Universal Recording. Samurai was comprised of the co-founders 
                      Johnny and Kerry as well as Denny, Nancy/Bes Isis, and Henry. His 
                      music became revolutionary, starting the rockerboy movement and 
                      becoming an overnight sensation. He rose to the top of the US 
                      charts in record time with his band. However despite their success, 
                      Samurai struggled as personal issues made it to the surface.</p>

                <div class="p-container">
                  <p>Johnny Silverhand was still one of the most popular musicians 
                    at the time. He planned to use his star power to begin a solo 
                    career and continue to push his anti-corporation and anti-government 
                    message. DBS Music wanted to sign him so desperately that they 
                    blackmailed him, threatening to reveal his true identity, as a 
                    deserter of the Central American Conflict. </p>
