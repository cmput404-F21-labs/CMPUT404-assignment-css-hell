Notes:
====================
I highly recommend not viewing bad.png full-screen and close-up. Especially opening up a page with such configuration.

Base HTML setup and css was taken from: https://boydstoast.com/
HTML ended up almost fully ovewritten to layout the elements properly.
CSS was cleaned up a lot and probably only 1 original rule is used in the final version that helped fitting nav bar in place.

Colour scheme(Blue and Yellow), Images and Bio text was taken from the wiki: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_Silverhand
Both of the sources are referenced on the webpage.
